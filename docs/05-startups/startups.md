# On Startups

Here is where I write about my attempts and learnings about building startups. More on these when I do reflection of my time spent over the past years.

[2023 - Microbots]({{site.baseurl}}/).
A fun research based project that didn't find much application.

[2023 - MoreMonuments]({{site.baseurl}}/).
Worked with Mo Mahmood for a few months attempting to build a statue in San Francisco.

[2022 - AuthEngine]({{site.baseurl}}/).
This was a SaaS startup. My friend Alex developed an api and library that enables OAuth in just a few lines of code. 

[2021 - Canin3D]({{site.baseurl}}/).
This was my first taste of the startup world. The goal was to 3D print concrete houses to solve housing in Canada. More writing on this in the future when I do some reflection.

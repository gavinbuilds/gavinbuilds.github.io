## [](#header-2)November - 2023
I had drove down to Lake Erie to purchase this lathe for 1200CAD. It barely fit in a sedan! I've been researching on what lathe to purchase for a while now and Facebook marketplace pulled through. I was seriously considering the Vevor 8x22" lathe.

### [](#header-3)Table to mount the lathe
Had to ditch the stand it came with because it didn't fit in the car.
I am a noob. So I spent a while thinking about how to rigidly mount this lathe for best performance. It seems that I ignored all the photos of people mounting the lathe to wood benches, tool cabinet tops, and other flimsy furniture. I wanted the best I can do.
I spent a while and came up with either 4545 extrusions or purchasing a metal table from global industrial. They were both going to end up similar in cost I think. So I went with purchasing the metal table.

More when I have creative juices...


### [](#header-3)Restoration
It is currently still sitting on the ground in my tool shed (LINK to tool shed page)
I'm currently disassembling the entire lathe, dunking it in Evaporust, and removing the old paint.

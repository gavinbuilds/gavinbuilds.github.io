## [](#header-2)1mm Micro Robots! - July:October 2023
After listening to this [Lex Fridman podcast with Neil Gershendfeld on self-replicating robots and fabrication](https://lexfridman.com/neil-gershenfeld/), I found myself really interested in reprap again. I had shared this podcast with a few friends and Kyrylo actually came to me with questions of how to make a machine to manufacture these little robots. Shortly after 2 weeks of texting back and forth, I was thinking about this idea every day, I joined Kyrylo on the project. 

### [](#header-3)EFAB
How do you make robots that are sized 1mm cubed?

Turns out the answer to that question was this method called Electrochemical Fabrication (EFAB). I think in the recent years, people like calling things electrochemical additive manufacturing now that 3d printing has gotten quite popular. Simply, there is a selective electrodeposition each layer just like how resin printers work.

#### Repeatable Z stage
With some spare parts I quickly made a stand with an z leadscrew motor to get accurate layers.

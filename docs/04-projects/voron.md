## [](#header-2)Voron 0.1 - November 2021
I started with a Fabreeko kit. It was a pre-order and their first batch. I kinda bought into the hype. 
Building a 3d printer with documentation is really not hard. The hard part is smoothing over undocumented problems. 8 times out of 10 you won't have any problems following a guide. But when that guide is not all inclusive, you need to improvise.
Different kits have different wiring, different hardware, and possibly different control boards. 
It's kinda up to you to build it after ordering everything.

## [](#header-2)0.1 -> 0.2 Conversion - Sept 2023
Some of the main changes to 0.2 were the SKR Pico board and the Raspberry Pi Pico or Zero 2 W. I just bought an SKR Pico becaue it had extra fan ports. I had also bought a Picobilical kit from LDO Motors.


## [](#header-2)Redoing the electronics - Dec 2023
I didn't like the DIN rail solution that Voron Design released. It still relied on taping relatively straight to the back acrylic panel. So generally measured out my setup and made a mounting board with an alignment jig.

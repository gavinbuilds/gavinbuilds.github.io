## [](#header-2)Summer 2021
My first 3d printer was an Ender 3 Pro off Amazon. It had the most warped build plate and I was stupid enough to go straight into modding it when I got it. Attempting to swap the mainboard, flash firmware, install a BLTouch...
Needless to say, I didn't get it working for a few months :).


### [](#header-3)TFT35 Touch Screen - 2022
I had bought a TFT35 (3.5inch touch screen) and I really wanted to use it. Designed a case and mount for it. Didn't end up using it because it started to look ugly.

### [](#header-3)Klipper Upgrade - 2022
Adding a spare raspberry pi 3b I had, I added a headless setup. It was using this side t-slot mounted pi case.

### [](#header-3)Sprite Pro Extruder Upgrade - 2022
When I wanted to reboot this printer I was looking to upgrade the extruder. It was between the Orbiter 2, the Sherpa mini, or the Creality Sprite Pro. I thought that it would be an easy drop in replacement since it was Creality BUT NO. IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT. I really wanted to use this CR-Touch I had bought a while back and there was no good way to mount the CR-Touch along with the Sprite Pro onto an Ender 3 Pro.
I had spent 8+ iterations to get a mounting plate going. Which I regret doing.

### [](#header-3)Front Electronics Enclosure - 2023
It was time to put the raspberry pi somewhere nicer. I didn't like the USB cable sticking out and I was still powering it with a separate power cable...
Now the setup has a 24v to 5v DC-DC converter to power the pi (I stole this from my Voron 0.1(LINK) when I upgraded)

### [](#header-3)Side PSU - 2023
Because of the electronics enclosure I made, I had to extend the main power cable from the PSU. While I was at it, I figured I might as well make it nicer so I quickly modified the stock PSU mount to sit on the side so it doesn't stick out the back; making the footprint smaller. The reason I had the PSU sticking out was because of my dual screw upgrade before.

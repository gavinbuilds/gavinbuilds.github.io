## [](#header-2)December 2022
I wanted to something with the parts leftover from the [concrete printer build](). I got really into the usefulness and precision of a waterjet cutter. After doing a lot of research, making a decent cutter would be very expensive - an intensifier pump being a few thousand dollars on Alibaba. So I settled on building a plasma cutter; the torch being the most expensive part of the build. 
I put my research into a [Notion page](https://gavinyuan.notion.site/Project-Plasma-Table-87d515ab125a42c89168fa6dc87ecdd8?pvs=4).

### [](#header-3)CAD
With a burst of inspiration, I spent about an hour to get a bare bones CAD going. I designed the table to have a 3'x4' working area so that I could purchase 4x8 sheets and use them with a support table.
[Link to Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/4eb2a349177d1e6b196b248b/w/abf4fc33ba408e6a2753c366/e/0c67c9dbbcf7366d661b5007?renderMode=0&uiState=65a18cb42700ae4c18e4c718)

I would have also needed to design a support table for the rest of the cantilevered sheet or even a way to feed it automatically.

### [](#header-3)Extrusions
Using 4040 extrusions for an easy transition to  my 20mm sized extrusions was the idea. However sourcing 40mm extrusion in Canada seems to be extremely tough...

### Conclusion?
It's January 2024 and I haven't executed on this project yet. I really stopped last year around this time, January 2023, because I wondered to myself: "What would I do with a plasma cutter? Make sheet metal boxes? For what?"

My thoughts on that is now differnt of course, I build these machines so that I can have manufacturing capability at home for any future projects. To work on projects is to improve my iteration speed on more projects!

So the latest idea of what to do with these extrusions is to design a Universal Gantry. Just like the E3D Tool Changer system, I plan to build a gantry that can be adapted to many manufacturing technologies. This would be a space efficient experimentation station for my manufacturing ideas.

## [](#header-2)December 2022
I wanted to something with the parts leftover from the [concrete printer build](). I got really into the usefulness and precision of a waterjet cutter. After doing a lot of research, to make a decent cutter would be very expensive - an intensifier pump being a few thousand dollars on Alibaba. So I settled on building a plasma cutter; the torch being the most expensive part of the build. 
I put my research into a [Notion page](https://gavinyuan.notion.site/Project-Plasma-Table-87d515ab125a42c89168fa6dc87ecdd8?pvs=4).

### [](#header-3)CAD
With a burst of inspiration, I spent about an hour to get a bare bones CAD going. I designed the table to have a 3'x4' working area so that I could purchase 4x8 sheets and use them with a support table.

I would have also needed to design a support table for the rest of the cantilevered sheet or even a way to feed it automatically.

### [](#header-3)Extrusions
Using 4040 extrusions for an easy transition to  my 20mm sized extrusions was the idea. However sourcing 40mm extrusion in Canada seems to be extremely tough...

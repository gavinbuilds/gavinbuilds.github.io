## September 2020 - April 2021
Was on the superstructures team. I worked briefly on Solidworks and helped research a new braking system. It was going to use steel angle actuated rotationally by a pneumatic cylinder into the snow. This was chosen because it could evacuate snow as well as provide the braking force.

Helped make the steering system. It used a rack and pinion just like how car steering works.

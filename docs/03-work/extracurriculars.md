## Stuffing all the school related activities here.
I honestly never learned a lot from school related activities because I felt they were insanely inefficient. In addition, I didn't feel enough agency in the tasks I took on in these groups. Not to mention that being in a lead position would entail lots of work that didn't move myself forward, such as managing young engineers.

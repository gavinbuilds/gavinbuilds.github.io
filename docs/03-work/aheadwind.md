# Ahead Wind
Ahead Wind is a pre-seed stage 3d printing software startup based in Denver, CO. I met them through Twitter thanks to Mo Mahmood. I jumped straight into writing python scripts and functions.

## Work I did
- [Dual sensor housing and mount]()
- [Establishing coordinate system]()
- [Print calibration sequence]()
- [Paraview image stacking]()

### Dual sensor housing and mounting
One of the problems we had with our layer scanner was a shadow caused by the lighting on an angle. The simple solution we thought of was to just put another scanner opposite to the current one so layers are evenly lighted from both sides.

### Establishing coordinate system
To analyze 3d prints,

## November 2022 - April 2023
The story behind this job was my friends at AheadWind had told me that manufacturing really wants talent and if I were to walk into a shop I'd be able to easily get a job. So what I did was read Starrett's Book for Student Machinists and ring up machine shops I could find on google. I called and went in-person. Landing myself at AACE Precision, a small 2 person shop that specialized in milling.

It was pretty cool to work on production parts and some 500 part orders. Great starting experience but I ended up leaving shortly after to pursue another [project]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/04-projects/more-monuments.html).
